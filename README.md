# Connect - PatientCenteredSystem

This is the project submission by Team Byte Panache for CODE INNOVATION SERIES HACKATHON - Vidyalankar Institute Of Technology.
Our Problem was from HealthCare domain - To enable a patient-centered information exchange system.

## Problem
In most facets of life in modern India, getting quality, clean, up-to-date data is difficult in the health sector. Data is incomplete (in many cases it excludes the private sector) and many a time, itâ€™s duplicated. When this insufficient and irrelevant data is provided to doctor during the treatment it can lead to severe complications and in some cases even death. 

## Solution
We have created a centralized database connecting patients, doctors and pathology. It generates a new patient id for each new patient and using this id, patients, doctors and medical professionals can easily access patient's medical history in the form of interactive graphs.
